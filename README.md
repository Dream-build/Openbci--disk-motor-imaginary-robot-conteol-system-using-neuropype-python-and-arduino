We are now on a project using motor imaginary to control a unique robot in order to assist human working in certain conditions. What special about our project on using motor imaginary is that we develop a new method in using MI to control devices, in which we called it: "the steering wheel". When the accumulation of the user's focus(R/L) is exceeding a certain number on the py script, it will rotate the pointer on the plate and deliver commands to the robot. Details of it's been attached here: https://b23.tv/OOLmST Video recording of our project:  https://www. bilili. com/video/BV1 ap4y1x7ZJ https://www.bilili.com/video/BV1fz4y1z7q3 We are a team from the Southwest Jiaotong University's Maker AssQ, one of the largest university maker asso in China, with the best equipments, resources and teachers in the university.
